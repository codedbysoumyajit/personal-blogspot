## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your blog platform up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)
* MongoDB (Community Edition or MongoDB Atlas account)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the code):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/codedbysoumyajit/personal-blogspot.git](https://github.com/codedbysoumyajit/personal-blogspot.git)
    cd personal-blogspot
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env` and add the following:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/personalblogdb
    SESSION_SECRET=a_very_long_and_random_string_for_session_secret_123abc456def
    ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password
    ```
    * **`MONGO_URI`**: Your MongoDB connection string. If using local MongoDB, the provided one works. For MongoDB Atlas, get your connection string from their dashboard.
    * **`SESSION_SECRET`**: A long, random string for securing your Express sessions. **Generate a strong one!**
    * **`ADMIN_USERNAME`**: The username for your blog's admin account.
    * **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: The password for your admin account. **Choose a strong password!**

4.  **Create the uploads directory:**
    This directory will store your uploaded header images.
    ```bash
    mkdir public/uploads
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start your MongoDB server:**
    If running locally, ensure your MongoDB instance is active. If using MongoDB Atlas, no local action is needed.

2.  **Start the Node.js application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    For development with automatic restarts on file changes, you can use `nodemon`:
    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon # If you don't have nodemon installed globally
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

## üîë Admin Access

On the first successful run, if no admin user exists in the database, a default admin user will be created using the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` specified in your `.env` file.

To log in:
1.  Go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/login`
2.  Enter the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from your `.env` file.
3.  You will be redirected to the admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`) where you can manage posts.
